LibraLife is a Python library for dealing with word pluralization.

## Installation

[XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)

## Usage

LibraLife is an app that enables users to create their own virtual bookshelf for their favorite books. They can add books to their shelf using a search engine, which displays the book cover and name of the searched book. If the search engine is not able to find the book, the user can manually add the book/series by taking a picture of the cover. Additionally, the user’s virtual bookshelf is presented as a “bookshelf-like” graphic of books overlaid together with their corresponding cover image. When a user clicks on a book name, it will display the book cover in detail and allow them to either delete it from the bookshelf or edit the books in that series. If there are multiple volumes in the same series, it will create a “stack” of books within the list.
